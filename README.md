# RISCV FPU Single Precision #

This floating point unit is conform to IEEE 754-2008 standards. Supported operations are **compare**, **min-max**, **conversions**, **addition**, **subtruction**, **multiplication**, **fused multiply add**, **square root** and **division** in single precisions. Except **square root** and **division** all operations are pipelined.

This unit uses canonical **nan** (not a number) form, if it generates any **nan** as output. E.g. 0x7FC00000. Therefore extra conditions are added in order compare outputs with testfloat data correctly by **nan** generation.

**Square root** and **division** calculations are using same subunit but different path (algorithm). This subunit has a generic variable **_performance_**. For functional iterations which are fast please use **1** and fixed point iterations which are slow use **0**. This unit has also own multiplier.
