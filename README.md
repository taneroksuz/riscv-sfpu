# RISCV FPU Single Precision #

This floating point unit is conform to IEEE 754-2008 standards. Supported operations are **compare**, **min-max**, **conversions**, **addition**, **subtruction**, **multiplication**, **fused multiply add**, **square root** and **division** in single precisions. Except **square root** and **division** all operations are pipelined.

This unit uses canonical **nan** (not a number) form, if it generates any **nan** as output. E.g. 0x7FC00000. Therefore extra conditions are added in order compare outputs with testfloat data correctly by **nan** generation.

**Square root** and **division** calculations are using same subunit but different path (algorithm). This subunit has a generic variable **_performance_**. For functional iterations which are fast please use **1** and fixed point iterations which are slow use **0**. This unit has also own multiplier.

## TOOLS ##

The installation scripts of necessary tools are located in directory **tools**. These scripts need **root** permission in order to install packages and tools for simulation and testcase generation. Please run these scripts in directory **tools** locally.

## GENERATE ##

To generate test cases you could use following command:

```console
make generate
```

## SIMULATION ##

To simulate the design together with generated test cases you could run following command:

```console
make simulation
```

This command require three options **LANGUAGE**, **DESIGN** and **TEST**. The possible settings of these options can be found in the makefile.

An example execution of this command looks like as follows:

```console
make simulation LANGUAGE=verilog DESIGN=fpu TEST=all
```

## SYNTHESIS ##

To generate synthesizable code of the design you could execute following command:

```console
make synthesis
```

This command creates **vhdl** and **verilog** codes in directory **synth**.
